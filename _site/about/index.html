    <p id="title">About Me</p>
    <p>
        I'm a computer science student based out of Ontario, Canada.
        My current professional interests lie in the fields of web and software development
        in the private sector.
        However,
        I am not closed off to work in other fields.
    </p>
    <p>
        Outside of work and school,
        I have a number of other hobbies and interests accrued over the years.
        Most notable
        - were you to ask my friends -
        is my interest in video games, especially fps games.
        Aside from that I have a general interest in tech, media, and culture.
