    <p id="title">On Mouse Friction in FPS</p>
    <div class="box" id="std-txt">
        <p>
            The friction that your mouse experiences affects your aim.
            For the sake of simplicity,
            when I write "friction" you can substitute "static friction" and "kinetic friction" where appropriate.
        </p>
        <p>
            When starting, adjusting, or continuing a mouse motion,
            the aimer has to exert enough force to overcome the friction acting on the mouse.
            When stopping a motion, keeping the motion steady, or holding a mouse position, the aimer works together with the friction in order to stop the motion.
            the friction and the aimer work together to achieve the goal.
        </p>
        <p>
            Increasing the friction your mouse experiences
            - using a "slower" mouse pad or "slower" mouse skates or a physically heavier mouse -
            exacerbates the experience described above.
            Your motions become steadier and firmer at the cost of having to fight the friction more in order to accomplish mouse movements.
        </p>
        <p>
            Decreasing the friction your mouse experiences
            - using a "faster" mouse pad or "faster" mouse skates or a physically lighter mouse -
            will make the opposite happen.
            Your motions become much easier and quicker to perform at the cost of becoming shakier as you no longer have the friction assisting you in smoothness or stopping power.
        </p>
        <p>
            Those who know about this
            - which includes you now that you've read this -
            often see it as a tradeoff that each player needs to weigh individually.
            Many tacfps players opt for a higher friction experience as their genre of choice has a high precision demand which rewards good stopping power.
            Conversely,
            we see many players in faster games such as arcade fps or battle royale opt for a lower friction experience as a higher level of spontanaity is required which rewards the ability to change things up and react quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many speed pad, aftermarket skate, and light mouse proponents as well as aim community members advocate for decreasing friction in pursuit of better aiming ability.
            The idea is that one is able to overcome the penalties that come with lower friction
            - lessened stopping power and exaggerated shakiness - 
            through practice and focused training.
            The result is that you're left with only the upsides of your motions requiring less force to start, change, and continue.
        </p>
        <p>
            One might think "can't you do the opposite with a higher friction setup?" but there is argumentation against such a notion.
            The downside of higher friction is that you have to exert more force in order to start, change, and continue motions.
            The thinking is that this will inherently make you a slower player as you will always have a delay to build up the force to move the mouse before adjusting the applied force to perform the motion you want to perform.
        </p>
        <p>
            This isn't the most convincing to people and there are no real scientific studies that have been done on this in an aiming context but it's interesting nonetheless.
        </p>
        <p>
            One thing that I think isn't really touched upon is the affect that this has on this with an inherent shakiness in their hands.
            There are players such as <a href="https://twitter.com/Pinguz_">Pinguz</a> with considerably high level of aiming skill despite their tremors.
            Pinguz has detailed in their
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1287kwnGBGkPaeEROIzo4WYhMWVde-Pzf/edit">hand tremor aim guide</a>
            that equipment like a glass mousepad is not in consdieration due to the tremors.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pinguz' is an extreme case but we still often observe in our daily lives that some people's hands are just steadier than others.
            In these cases one might try to train their hands to be more steady in general.
            Improving base dexterity and stability through hand exercises and stretches as well as training grip strength.
            Another thing to consider are general lifestyle factors such as
            caffeine or alcohol intake, meal timings, stress levels, and amount of sleep one gets in a night.
        </p>
        <p>
            With all of this being said,
            it's not as though you need to force yourself to adapt to lower friction in order to have good aim.
            Many tacfps pros use heavy mice on slow pads and are fine in terms of their aim.
            Weigh the pros and cons for yourself and see if you are willing and able to take the hit to your aim's stability - and maybe your ego - in exchange for speed and maneuverability.
